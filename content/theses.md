Students are invited to work on bachelor's or master's theses on topics linked to the research areas of the ongoing projects and on the general scope of the work within the team. Note that with some exceptions of urban morphology, primarily quantitative methods are expected to be used.

*Projects can be written in Czech or English.*

## Urban morphology

### Culture and politics and their effects on the shape of urban development

*Echoes of the past in the shape of our cities*

The project shall quantitatively explore the relationship between how cities are built and the cultural and political context that has influenced that. The scope can vary from local to global use cases.

### Social diversity of housing

The ability of types of housing to host people from different socio-economic population groups differs, but it is largely unmapped. The work shall look at selected aspects of population composition and evaluate how different housing patterns (e.g., single-family housing, perimeter blocks, housing estates) support various population groups.

### Spatial distribution of amenities in relation to street network connectivity in Prague

Allocation of amenities follows the structure of cities, particularly linked to street network configuration, population density and major transportation hubs (e.g. subway stations). The project shall explore the effects of these components on the spatial distribution of POIs in Prague. The project will be done in collaboration with the Institute of Planning and Development Prague (IPR).

## Classification of urban environments

The complexity of the urban environment is unfathomable. To be able to work with it, we need to reduce its dimensionality to a subset of categories roughly representing the breadth of options. Students are invited to develop such classification, capturing selected perspectives of urban analytics.

### People: spatial dimension of behaviour

The project aims to develop a quantitative classification of the population based on selected aspects of human behaviour (e.g. internet usage patterns and daily mobility).

### Places: what is around

Classification of urban space according to its function. Where do we find specific categories of POIs? Which places are more accessible than the others? Why is that?

## Satellite imagery in cities

On rare occasions, students can apply for projects falling under earth observation. This topic requires Python-based methods to be used.

### See the invisible: how much can be sensed from above?

An assessment of the ability of multispectral satellite imagery to *sense* various aspects of an urban environment. We know we can directly capture specific components of cities (think about greenery, heat, emissions, and land cover), but other aspects can be seen indirectly. Can we sense wealth? Deprivation? Population diversity? This project shall explore the feasibility of relying on openly available satellite imagery to predict concepts of urbanised life that are not immediately visible.

## Spatial Data Science and advanced methods of quantitative geography

Proposals methodically falling under spatial data science and usage of advanced methods of quantitative geography are generally welcome even on topics other than those listed above.
